hi there, thanks for viewing the slides of the talk I gave :)
I've provided a .ps file for easy consumption, but if you'd like to try out
the slideshow library of Racket https://racket-lang.org/ you can run
`racket envirocomputing-nov5.rkt --widescreen` after installing racket,
`raco pkg install slideshow-text-style` as well as installing the Fira Sans font
